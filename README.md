# 1NEON

The neon1 client portal at [neon1.tech/1NEON](https://neon1.tech/1NEON/). Each project runs through four layers: Needs, Execute, Observe, and Normalize. Proposals, decisions, files, and results stay together from the first call to handover.

- `apps/web`: the React app
- `apps/api`: the API, one Lambda behind API Gateway
- `packages/domain`: the model and permission rules both share
- `infra`: Terraform for everything behind the edge (see [infra/README.md](infra/README.md))

The site's design (fonts, colors, and the rain) loads from [neon1-site](https://github.com/neon1llc/neon1-site).

## Run it locally

Node 22.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # app on http://localhost:5173/1NEON/, API in memory with demo data
npm run check   # types, tests, and build
```

Locally there's no sign-in. Pick a demo account from the switcher on the sign-in screen.

## Dev

[dev.neon1.tech/1NEON](https://dev.neon1.tech/1NEON/) is a private copy of the portal, behind dev.neon1.tech's sign-in. It runs `infra/envs/dev`: its own API, table, documents bucket, and sign-in pool on auth-dev.neon1.tech, with no texts, no malware scan, and locked records kept one day.

- **Deploys:** pushing the `dev` branch ships the functions and the app in about a minute. `dev-sync` merges main into `dev` after every push to main. Dev is never tagged; changelog entries wait under `## Unreleased`, and each work branch goes to main on its own.
- **Data:** `AWS_PROFILE=neon1 node scripts/dev-data.mjs --yes` replaces dev's table and documents with a copy of production's (production is only read). Queued messages, sessions, and sign-in links are left out, so everyone signs in to dev again.
- **neon1 only:** because that copy names real clients, dev (`APP_ENV=dev`, see `apps/api/src/dev-guard.ts`) admits only operators and neon1.tech addresses, sends mail only to them, and creates no accounts for anyone else. The dev pool holds neon1 admins only.
- **Signing in:** use the email code. A production passkey shows up because passkeys belong to neon1.tech, but the dev pool doesn't know it; add a dev passkey from your profile after signing in.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` deploys. GitHub Actions applies `infra/envs/prod` and ships the functions and the app with AWS roles assumed through OIDC, so the repo holds no AWS keys.

## License

The code is MIT licensed (see `LICENSE`). The license covers the code only: the neon1 and 1NEON names, logos, and other brand marks are not licensed, so please don't use them in a way that suggests your work comes from neon1 LLC. Third-party packages keep their own licenses.
